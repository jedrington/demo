# Templates

This directory includes two directories, 'build' and 'deploy', which include templates and params files for use with the OpenShift cluster life-cycle management Ansible playbook - the `openshift-applier`. 

Also included at the root of the repo is an example Jenkinsfile which can be used as a starting place to create your own CI/CD pipeline.

The values in the examples are there for demonstration purposes, but they should be changed according to your environment.
